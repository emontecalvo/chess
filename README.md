3)  Please download the zipfile from this repo and install

4)  cd into the directory.

###PLAY:###

This is a basic chess game meant for two humans.

This does not include the advanced chess moves like Castling, En Passant, etc.

To make a move, use your keyboard arrow keys and hit "Enter" to select the piece you want to move.

Then, select the square you want to move the piece to by using the arrow keys again and hitting "Enter" once more.

If the move is invalid, the game will let you know and will not continue until you make a valid move.

###TECHNOLOGY:###
